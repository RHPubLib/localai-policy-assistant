# RHPL Local RAG — Staff Policy & Procedures AI Assistant

Resources from **Rochester Hills Public Library (RHPL)** for running a local AI assistant
that answers staff questions about library policies and procedures — entirely on library-owned
hardware, with no data leaving the building.

---

## What This Is

Rochester Hills Public Library built a local AI assistant that helps staff quickly find
answers to policy and HR questions without having to search through binders, shared drives,
or PDF folders. Staff type a question in plain English:

- *"How many sick days do I get?"*
- *"What's the process for requesting bereavement leave?"*
- *"Can I renew a patron's card over the phone?"*
- *"What's our policy on patron behavior in the building?"*

The assistant reads RHPL's official policy documents and answers directly from them — citing
the specific policy number and document name so staff can always verify the source. Open WebUI
even surfaces the source document inline so staff can click through to read the full policy.

**The model only answers from official documents.** It does not guess, invent, or draw on
outside knowledge. If the answer isn't in the knowledge base, it says so and directs staff
to the library director. This makes it a reliable first stop, not a replacement for judgment.

### Why local matters

Staff questions about HR, leave, pay, and conduct involve sensitive information. Running this
model locally means those conversations stay inside RHPL's network — they are never sent to
OpenAI, Google, or any other cloud service. The same is true for patron-facing policy
questions that involve circulation rules, fines, or card eligibility.

There are no per-query fees. The model runs on hardware RHPL already owns and operates as
part of its local AI infrastructure (shared with the Polaris SQL helper — see
[polaris-sql-assistant](https://github.com/RHPubLib/polaris-sql-assistant)).

### A cloud-based alternative

RHPL also offers staff a second way to ask the same policy questions, built on Google's
Vertex AI and surfaced right inside the Gmail sidebar:
[**gmail-policy-assistant**](https://github.com/RHPubLib/gmail-policy-assistant). It's the same
grounded, citation-first approach as this project — answers come only from RHPL's policy
documents — packaged for one-click access without leaving Gmail. The two are complementary:
this repo keeps everything on library-owned hardware with no data leaving the building; the
add-on trades that for lower setup effort and tighter Workspace integration. Pick whichever
fits your library's privacy posture and infrastructure.

## Hardware Requirements

This model runs on the same server as RHPL's other local AI tools. A GPU with at least
10 GB VRAM is sufficient for a policies-and-procedures RAG model — the queries are
conversational rather than computationally intensive.

| Model | Min VRAM | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Qwen3-7B | ~10 GB | Good quality for RAG/Q&A tasks |
| Qwen3-14B-FP8 | ~15 GB | RHPL's model until 2026-07 (now Qwen3.6-35B-A3B GGUF via llama.cpp) |
| Any instruction-tuned model | varies | Llama 3, Mistral, etc. will also work |

Any NVIDIA (CUDA) or AMD (ROCm) GPU will work. This use case is less demanding than SQL
generation — a modest GPU is sufficient if it's dedicated to this workload.

RHPL currently runs **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** (GGUF Q4_K_XL) on an **AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700**
(RDNA4 / gfx1201, 32 GB VRAM) served by **llama.cpp under Vulkan** (since 2026-07-09;
formerly Qwen3-14B-FP8 on vLLM/ROCm, which is retained as a rollback profile — see
`/var/opt/rhpl/INFRA-FACTS.md`). Quantization quality matters for policy questions,
where a subtly wrong answer is worse than no answer. The same server also hosts RHPL's
Polaris SQL helper.

## How It Works

### The document pipeline

```
Original policy documents          Docling Serve             Open WebUI
(PDF, Word, PowerPoint)    ──►    (PDF → Markdown)    ──►   Knowledge Base
```

1. **Source documents** — RHPL's policy and procedure documents live in an organized folder
   structure on the server, grouped by category (Personnel Policies, Public Service
   Policies, Staff Knowledge, etc.). Documents can be PDF, Word (`.docx`), PowerPoint, or
   Excel.

2. **Docling conversion** — [Docling Serve](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) runs as a
   Docker container and converts each document to clean Markdown. It uses OCR (Tesseract)
   for scanned PDFs, accurate table detection, and preserves document structure. The
   converted Markdown files mirror the original folder hierarchy.

3. **Knowledge base upload** — A Python script wipes and re-uploads all converted Markdown
   files to an Open WebUI knowledge base named **"RHPL Policies & Procedures"**. Open WebUI
   chunks, embeds, and indexes the content for retrieval.

4. **Model configuration** — A custom model in Open WebUI (`rhpl-policies-and-procedures`)
   is attached to the knowledge base and given a system prompt that constrains it to answer
   only from retrieved documents and to cite policy numbers.

When a staff member asks a question, Open WebUI retrieves the most relevant document chunks
and passes them to the model along with the question. The model answers using only what was
retrieved.

### Optional: inline definitions

RHPL's policies define key terms (e.g., "Immediate Family") in a single central definitions
document. A retrieval system can miss those when the term appears in a *different* policy, so
RHPL adds a small pre-upload step that injects the relevant definition inline into each policy
that uses the term. This avoids relying on a second retrieval hop to resolve a definition and
noticeably improves answers on questions like bereavement-leave eligibility. If your policies
have a similar central glossary, the same technique applies.

### Smart vocabulary translation

The system prompt instructs the model to translate staff casual language into policy
vocabulary before searching. For example:

| Staff asks… | Model searches for… |
|-------------|---------------------|
| "time off when someone dies" | bereavement leave |
| "call in sick" | sick leave |
| "can I work from home" | telework |
| "got hurt at work" | workers compensation |
| "written up" | disciplinary action |

This means staff don't need to know the official HR term — they can ask naturally.

## Repository Layout

```
README.md                    This file
system-prompt.md             The model's system prompt — paste into Open WebUI
docling-batch-convert.py     Converts source documents to Markdown via Docling Serve
owui-reload-kb.py            Wipes and re-uploads the Open WebUI knowledge base
```

---

## Setting Up the Knowledge Base

### 1. Run the infrastructure

You need three services running:

- **Open WebUI** — the chat interface and knowledge base engine
- **An LLM** — served via llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible backend
- **Docling Serve** — for converting PDFs and Word docs to Markdown

See RHPL's [polaris-sql-assistant](https://github.com/RHPubLib/polaris-sql-assistant)
for a full infrastructure setup guide using Docker Compose on an AMD ROCm GPU. The same
stack supports both tools.

### 2. Organize your policy documents

Create a folder structure on your server that mirrors your document categories. For example:

```
/path/to/kb-sources/
  Personnel Policies/
    General/
    Benefits/
    Work Rules/
  Public Service Policies/
    Circulation Policies/
    Customer Service Policies/
  Staff Knowledge/
```

Any folder depth works — Docling and the upload script traverse subdirectories recursively.

### 3. Convert documents to Markdown

Update the `INPUT_DIRS` and `OUTPUT_BASE` paths in `docling-batch-convert.py` to match your
folder structure, then run it:

```bash
python3 docling-batch-convert.py
```

Conversion is resumable — already-converted files are skipped. Docling handles scanned PDFs,
tables, and multi-column layouts well. Review the output Markdown for any documents that
converted poorly (complex forms and scanned images with low resolution may need manual
cleanup).

### 4. Create the knowledge base in Open WebUI

1. In Open WebUI, go to **Workspace → Knowledge → Create**
2. Name it something like **"RHPL Policies & Procedures"**
3. Use the upload script (`owui-reload-kb.py`) to upload all converted Markdown files, or
   upload them manually via the UI

### 5. Configure the model

1. In Open WebUI, go to **Workspace → Models → Create**
2. Set the base model to your Qwen3 (or other) model
3. Set **Temperature** to `0.1` — low temperature gives consistent, factual answers and
   reduces the chance of the model embellishing beyond what the documents say
4. Attach the knowledge base you created
5. Paste the contents of `system-prompt.md` into the **System Prompt** field
6. Save the model

---

## System Prompt

The full system prompt is in [`system-prompt.md`](system-prompt.md). Key behaviors it
enforces:

- **Documents only** — the model answers exclusively from retrieved policy documents and
  explicitly states when an answer is not found
- **Source citations** — every answer cites the policy document name and number
  (e.g., *"Per CIRC-2 Loan and Renewal Policy…"*)
- **Policy vs. Guidelines** — the model distinguishes between a Policy (binding rule) and
  Guidelines (procedural guidance), which is how RHPL's documents are structured
- **Redirect when unknown** — if the answer isn't in the knowledge base, the model says
  so clearly and directs the staff member to the library director

Adapt the prompt to match your library's document naming conventions and structure.

## Google Workspace Authentication

RHPL restricts access to `localai.rhpl.org` using Google OAuth — staff sign in with their
`@rhpl.org` Google Workspace accounts. No separate username or password is required, and
anyone outside the `rhpl.org` domain is blocked automatically.

This is configured entirely through Open WebUI environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.
No custom code is needed.

### How it works

When a staff member visits the site, they see only a **Sign in with Google** button. After
authenticating with their Google Workspace account, Open WebUI checks that their email domain
matches `rhpl.org` and creates (or logs into) their account automatically. The local
username/password login form is disabled entirely.

### docker-compose.yml environment variables

Add these to your `open-webui` service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=${OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
  - OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=${OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}
  - OAUTH_PROVIDER_NAME=Google
  - OPENID_PROVIDER_URL=https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
  - OAUTH_SCOPES=openid email profile
  - OAUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=yourlibrary.org
  - ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP=true
  - DEFAULT_USER_ROLE=user
  - WEBUI_AUTH=true
  - ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM=false
```

Store the actual client ID and secret in a `.env` file alongside `docker-compose.yml` (never
commit them to the repository):

```
OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

### Setting up the Google OAuth app

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project
   (or use an existing one in your Google Workspace org)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**
   - Set User type to **Internal** — this restricts the app to your Google Workspace domain
     only and requires no Google review
   - Fill in app name, support email, and developer contact
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - Add your Open WebUI URL to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     `https://your-openwebui-server/oauth/oidc/callback`
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into your `.env` file
5. Restart the Open WebUI container — the Google login button appears automatically

### Key settings explained

| Variable | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `OAUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=yourlibrary.org` | Blocks any Google account not from your domain |
| `ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP=true` | Auto-creates an account on first login — no manual user provisioning needed |
| `DEFAULT_USER_ROLE=user` | New accounts get standard user access; promote specific staff to Admin in the UI |
| `ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM=false` | Hides the email/password form entirely — Google is the only login option |

### Why this matters for a library

Using Google Workspace SSO means:
- Staff use credentials they already have and rotate automatically with their Google account
- No separate password database to manage or secure
- Leavers lose access automatically when their Google Workspace account is suspended
- IT can see who has access via the Google Admin Console

## Using This at Your Library

This setup is entirely document-agnostic — any library (or any organization) can load their
own policy documents and use the same pipeline.

**To adapt for your library:**

- Replace RHPL's source documents with your own policies, procedures, handbooks, and
  staff guides
- Update the system prompt to reference your library's name and any document naming
  conventions you use (e.g., your policy numbering scheme)
- Adjust the temperature if needed — `0.1` works well for factual Q&A, but a slightly
  higher value (e.g., `0.3`) may give more natural-sounding answers if the responses feel
  too terse
- The knowledge base can include any staff-facing documents: HR policies, circulation rules,
  customer service scripts, board policies, emergency procedures, etc.

**Document quality matters.** The model can only answer as well as the documents it retrieves.
Policies that are clearly written, well-organized, and consistently named will produce better
answers than legacy documents with inconsistent formatting.

## Contributing

If you adapt this for your library and make improvements to the system prompt, pipeline
scripts, or document structure, pull requests are welcome. The goal is to make this replicable
for any library that wants to give staff faster, more consistent access to institutional
knowledge.
